The theme of my application was an online crystal retailer.
The home page gives a brief description of the different types of crystals in inventory, and a button will direct you to each of the different varieties.

The header consists of several buttons.
the first is the image of a green pixel crystal. that will navigate you back to the home page.
The cog wheel is supposed to take you to the admin page, if you logged in and have the appropriate cookie. From here you would be able to see the full inventory, add new items, and delete items.
The shopping cart, was a stretch goal to implement, but clicking it adds to a counter that increases until 99.
The fingerprint icon/button is how you log in.
